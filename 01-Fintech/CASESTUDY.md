# ROBINHOOD CASE STUDY

## OVERVIEW AND ORIGIN 

Robinhood is an American company that offers a mobile app and website which allows commission-free trading. Robinhood was founded in April 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt and the app was launched in March 2015. The company aimed to make financial markets more accessible to average people instead of just the wealthy. Tenev noted that executing a trade costs very little, yet brokerages typically charge fees of $5 to $10 per trade. In April 2017, Robinhood was valued at $1.3 billion and was able to raise $110 million. In May 2018, they were able to raise $539 million in venture capital. 

## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Robinhood is working to make financial markets more accessible with an intuitive and user-friendly mobile app accompanied by commission-free trading. Roughly half of their customers are first-time investors. The company’s intended customer seems to be younger, less experienced traders. In 2015, 80% of their customers were “Millennials” with the average customer age of 26. To provide their product, Robinhood uses many different technologies. They use Python, Bootstrap, Django, Swift, Git and many more.

## LANDSCAPE

Robinhood was originally solely in the investment management domain of Financial Tech. However, they have recently ventured into other domains as well. Their app now offers some cryptocurrency trading and cash management. Robinhood’s main competitors are Firstrade, M1 Finance, Merrill Edge, TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers. All of these companies provide low-cost trading.

## RESULTS

Robinhood has led to many brokerages introducing commission-free trading, and have certainly placed a pressure on other brokerages to look into it. Robinhood has caused an influx of less experienced traders and first-time traders. This has impacted trends in the stock market and the way people invest. For example, during Covid-19, many more investors are eager to invest in troubled companies. While Robinhood did not directly cause this, it definitely impacted Tesla’s decision to split their shares. Robinhood can use their amount of customers to measure their success in this domain. Their customer base has continued to grow, and with that the company’s valuation has increased. While competitors are catching up, Robinhood is still succeeding.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

If I were to advise the company, there are a few suggestions I would make. First, I’d suggest they make more changes to accommodate experienced traders. I would push for them to further improve their user interface for accessibility and ease of use so they can capitalize on one of their greatest assets. Robinhood’s selection of stocks to trade is also limited. I believe this could push users from their platform to competitors as they grow more experienced with trading. This probably would not require much more technologies than those they are already using.
